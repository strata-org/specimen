/-- To make the derived generators below compile, we need to
    manually add a dummy instance of `ArbitrarySizedSuchThat` for one of the relations, since Lean doesn't support
    mutually recursively typeclass instances currently.

    Note that the instance of `ArbitrarySizedSuchThat` for `Odd` below (produced by `derive_generator`)
    will shadow this one -- it takes precedence over this dummy instance.


    Note from Segev: This does not work, it remembers the old instance from when it was defined. -/
